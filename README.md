# Pokemon Quiz

A simple, educational Pokemon quiz app built with Flutter. The UI was
designed in Figma and the project includes exported assets under
`assets/images`.

## Design

- **Figma**: A [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/WfZj6GyKaUYr5TGo6A0Cai/Fluttter-Pokemon-Quiz-App?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=SKlPEul4iXyRXBWS-0) was prepared to guide the UI/UX.
- **Assets**: Exported images and icons live in `assets/images`.

## Features

- Multiple-choice Pokemon trivia questions
- Score tracking and basic result screen
- Responsive layout that runs on desktop and mobile targets

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Ensure you have a supported platform set up (Windows, Android, iOS, web)

### Run locally

Open PowerShell in the project root and run:

```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter run -d windows
```

Replace `-d windows` with an appropriate device id (for example `-d chrome`
or an Android emulator) to run on other targets.

## Contributing
